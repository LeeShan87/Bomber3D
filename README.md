# Bomber3D

I'm thinking about ways, how can I show my previous work. Well, the ones I have permission to do so. :D

And I found an old video about one of my side projects when I was at the university.

It was called Bomber3D.

The original YouTube video is available at:

Its music is annoying as hell, but at least loud.

This project will be mentioned In an upcoming blog post of mine.

## Deprecated Notice

This project originally used Unity ~4.5 around 2012. I could migrate it to a newer version, but hear it is not the point.
